<h1>Austen's Favourite Films</h1>
<h2>The Top 3 (in no official order)</h2>

<hr />

<ul>
    <li><h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <p>
        Most visually magnificent film I have ever seen,
        tells such a mind bending and gripping story, and has one of the best soundtracks in cinema.
        </p></li>
    <li><h3>How to Train Your Dragon 2</h3>
        <p>
        A classic from my later childhood. Incredibly moving story, and the way it presents the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless
        is so profound. The soundtrack is very different from Interstellar, yet it rivals its quality. This will always be
        one of my favourites of all time.
        </p></li>
    <li><h3>Captain America: Civil War</h3>
        <p>
        In terms of quality, this might not even be my favourite marvel film, yet the impact it had on me in 2016 was huge.
        This film alone got me into marvel, and I watched it on repeat so many times. It was practically an avengers film 
        with the cast it had, and I always loved the story and the action so much. The rifts and the betrayals were so 
        meaningful, and both sides were explainable and were difficult for even the viewer to decide. Great visuals and 
        great characters. All around brilliant film.
